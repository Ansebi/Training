Good morning, Tom. It's time to get up.
Is it 7:00 already? I'm still sleepy.
That's okay, dear. Are you Hungry?
Yes, mom. I am so hungry. Can I have pancakes?
Of course, you can. I'll get them ready.
Thanks, mom. I'm on my way!
It's a beautiful morning, son.
Yes, it's a sunny day.

Teacher, I have a question to ask.
What is your question?
Are we going to play this morning?
Yes, we are, but not right now.
When are we going to play?
As soon as we finish our lesson.
Can't we go a little early today?
Maybe, if we finish our lesson early.

Come on Lisa. Let's play a game.
Okay, Joey. What shall we play?
How about kickball. It's fun.
Okay, but I don't know how.
It's easy, Jenny. You just kick the ball.
I know that, but where do we kick it?
Just anywhere. It's a lot of fun.
Hey, this is fun. Thanks, Joey.

Teacher, I have a question.
Please raise your hand, Karen.
Raise my hand?
Yes. Raise your hand first.
Okay, teacher. My hand is up.
Yes, Karen. What is your question?
What time is class over?
It is over at 2:00 o'clock.

Teacher! May I go to the bathroom?
Class is over in 5 minutes, Donna.
Can I go then?
Yes, you can, Donna.
I don't know if I can hold it.
If you can't, then go, dear.
I think I can go in a few minutes.
Thank you, Donna.

Hi, Linda. What are you doing?
I am fingerpainting, Laura.
That looks like fun. Can I try?
Sure, you can. Sit down here.
What do I do?
First, you have to get a piece of paper.
Okay. I got it.
Use my colors to draw. It's fun.

Hey, Mark. What are you doing?
I am going to use the slide, Sarah.
Can I come with you?
Sure, you can. It's fun.
Okay. Where do I go?
Follow me up the ladder, Sarah.
This is fun.
Now slide down. It's fast and fun.

Hey, Lisa. Let's go ride the merry-go-round.
What is that?
It's a game we can play. Follow me.
Okay, Carol. Let's go.
Here you get on. I'll push.
Wow! This goes fast. Jump on!
Okay. Here I go!
Yay! This is fun!

What do you have for lunch, David?
I have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
That sounds good. I have tuna.
Tuna is good too, Daniel.
I like jelly. Do you want to trade?
Sure. I like tuna.
This trade is good for both of us.
Yes, it is. Thanks, Daniel.

Today we are going to the library.
What is library, Ms. Thomas?
It is a place to study, Betty.
What do they have there?
Books, computers, classes, and more.
That sounds like fun.
It is, Betty. And you can learn there.
I can't wait to go. Let's go!

This is your first day of school, Helen.
I know, mom. I am so happy.
That makes me happy, too.

My stomach hurts.
Oh no. Let me get some medicine.
Okay, mommy.

Thank you, mom.
I'll call the school. Try to rest, dear.

Hi Maria. Want to color with me?
Sure, Sandra. I love to color.
This is blue. It's my favorite color.
I like blue, too.
What's your favorite color?
I don't know, maybe pink.
Here, try this pink. It's pretty.
Yes, it is. It's perfect!

Good morning, Jennifer.
Hi Michelle. How are you?
I'm happy. How about you?
Me, too. Who is that?
That's my baby brother Paul.

He is only three years old.
I wish I had a baby brother.

That's perfect! Let's play.

Good morning Jennifer.
Hi, Nancy. You are here early.
My mom drove me to school today.
You don't take the school bus?
Not always.
I take the bus every day.
I used to. Now my mom drives me.
I like taking the bus.

Today we go on our field trip class.
Where are we going Mr. Edwards?
We are going to a museum, George.
That sounds like fun.
It is George. Is everyone ready?
We are ready teacher.
There's the bus. Let's get on.
We like going on field trips.

Ms. Thomas. I'm not feeling well.
What is it Elizabeth?
My head hurts.
You may have a headache.
Yes, I think I do.
Let's go see the school nurse.
Okay, Ms. Thomas.
I'll be back in class. Try to be quiet.


Are we going to the park today, mom?
Of course we will, David.
When can we go?
After our chores are done.
Okay. What should I do?
First, finish your homework.
I am already finished, mom.
Clean your room, and we can go.

Hello Mary. How was school today?
It was great, mom. Thanks.
Do you have any homework?
Yes. I do, in math and English.
Have something to eat first.
Okay, mom.
You can do homework after dinner.
Sounds good, mom. Thank you.

Wow! It sure is hot today.
Yes, it is. It's probably 90 degrees.
Did you want to go somewhere?
Sure! How about a movie?
A movie would be great, Lisa.
Yes. It will be cool there.
Going to a movie is a great idea.
Anything to cool us down, Alice.

Is this your first baseball game, Anthony?
Yes, it is. Donna. How about you?
No. I have come to a lot of games.
You are so lucky.
My big brother is working at the stadium.
He is working there?
Yes, and he got me into a lot of games.
Wow. That must be nice.

Let's go to see a movie, Anthony.
That sounds great, Lisa.
What do you want to see?
Let's see something funny.
Do you know of a good one?
Yes, but let's pick one we both like.
All right. We can look online.
That's a great idea, Lisa.

I love going to the movies.
Me too, Helen.
We have to pay first, Daniel.
I know. There's the line to pay.
Hurry before the line gets too long.
I am hurrying!
Do you want to get some popcorn?
Sure. What's a movie without popcorn?

Maria! It's time for dinner.
Okay, mommy. I'm on my way.
Sit on that chair, dear.
This one?
Yes, Maria. The big chair.
I never sat here before.
I made chicken tonight.
Yum! I love your chicken, mom.

Hi Betty. Want to go for a ride?
Where to, Sarah?
Nowhere special. Just a ride.
That sounds like fun.
Yes. It is.
Do you have enough gas?
Yes, I do.
Here is some money for gas anyway.

I am so excited about tomorrow, mommy.
I know, dear, but it is bedtime.
Okay. I hope I can sleep.
Just close your eyes, and sleep will come.
Can I get on the big rides tomorrow?
I think so, if you are tall enough.
I'm sure I am.
Then you can get on them tomorrow.

This place is so cool.
It is, Linda. I love it here.
What do you want to do?
How about a roller coaster?
Aren't those scary.
A little bit, but they are safe.
Okay. How about that one?
Yes. That one is fun!

Okay Laura. Let's go.
Just a second, mom.
Don't forget to put on your seatbelts.
Do I have to?
Yes. You have to.
But we are only going to the store.
It's the law, Laura.
And to be safe, too. Right, mom?

Look at that guy, Donald.
What guy, Dorothy?
The one with his head down.
He is looking at his cell phone.
I know, but he didn't see that car.
What car?
A car almost hit him.
Wow. We should always pay attention.

Hey Joseph. Want to play?
Sure, Steven. What do you want to play?
How about Hide and Seek?
How do you play that?
I'll close my eyes and count to 10.
What do I do?
You hide. Then I'll go look for you.
That sounds like fun.

Robert! Can you come here?
Okay, mom. I'm on my way.
Would you take the trash out, dear?
The can is empty, mom.
No. Not this one. The outside can.
The big can?
Yes. Put it in the street. It's Tuesday.
That's right. Pick-up is tomorrow.

Good morning, Michael.
Good morning, mom.
Today is your first swimming lesson.
I know. I'm a little scared.
Don't be, dear. You will like it.
I hope so.
The teacher is very good.
Okay, mom. I'll give it my best.

This is my first boat ride, Patricia.
It's mine too, Sandra.
Is it safe?
I thinks so. Daddy goes all the time.
He told me we can row the boat.
Row the boat?
Yes. Take this oar and row.
Wow. This is fun. We are moving.

Today we are flying, Richard.
Are you sure it's safe, dad?
Of course, son. I fly all the time.
Can't we drive to grandma's house?
Yes, we can, but it takes longer.
Okay, dad. We'll fly.
You are going to love it, son.
I hope so.

We are taking off, Margaret.
Wow. We are going super fast!
It's just on the takeoff. You'll see.
Wow! It's beautiful up here.
Yes it's awesome.
I think I like this, Daniel.
I like the takeoff and the landings.
I can't wait to land.

Can you give me a hand, Nancy?
Sure, dad. What can I do?
I need to change a tire.
Okay. I'd love to help.
Hand me that tool, dear.
Here it is, dad.
You are a good helper.
Thanks, dad.

I am taking you to the dentist today.
Oh, no. Do I have to go, mom?
Don't worry, Joey.
Going to the dentist hurts, mom.
This is just a checkup.
What is a checkup?
It's to see if your teeth are okay.
That's not so bad.

Good morning Jason. Time to get up.
Good morning, mom. Is it Christmas?
Yes, dear. It's Christmas morning.
Yay! Can I open my presents?
Of course, you can.
I can't wait to see what I got.
Go ahead. This box is from your sister.
I hope it's a racecar!

Can you help me, Barbara?
Sure, dad. With what?
It's time to decorate our Christmas tree.
That sounds like fun!
Here is the tinsel, and the lights.
Can I string the lights, dad?
Sure, Barbara. Go all the way around.
I like decorating the tree.

Gee, dad. Is my mom okay?
Of course she is, Sharon.
But we are at the hospital.
It's because she is having a baby tonight.
Tonight? Are you sure?
Yes, Sharon. You are getting a baby sister.
A baby sister? Wow! I can't wait.
Your mom will be fine. Don't worry.

Are you nervous, Patricia?
Nervous about what, Kimberly?
About today's math test.
No. I'm not nervous.
Why not?
I like doing math.
I don't. It's hard for me.
Meet me after school. I can help you.


What's the teacher doing, Richard?
She is calling the roll, Jennifer.
What does it mean?
It is to check who is in class today.
What should I do?
"When she calls your name, say ""here."""
What is that for?
So that she knows you are here today.

What's that bell for?
It means it's recess time, Charles.
What's that?
It's a break from class.
A break? For what, Kevin?
So we can play outside.
Really? Wow! Let's go.
Yes. It's fun. We get one breaks per hour.

Jason. It's time to feed the dog.
Already, mom? Okay.
We have to feed him twice a day.
What should I give him?
One can and one scoop of dry food.
Is that all?
Yes. That's plenty.
He really likes it, mom.

Today we go to the dog pound.
What's that dad?
It is where we can pick a dog.
Really. We're getting a dog?
I thought you wanted one Richard.
I do dad!
Okay. Let's get ready.
I'm going to name him Max!

Mommy. Can I have a cat?
A cat? Why do you want one, Margaret?

You have to take care of it.

Okay, Margaret. You'll have a cat.

Hey, James. You want to play?
Not right now, Elizabeth.
Come on. It'll be fun.

How about playing tag?
That's boring. Let's play hide-and-seek.
Okay. Who goes first?
I'll hide first.

Hi Lisa. How are you?
I'm fine. What are you doing?
I'm reading a book.
Really? All of it?
No. Just this part.
Who's that?
It's Mary. She has a dog.
Let's read it together.

Do you know the Alphabet song?
The alphabet song?

It's easy, Sharon.
Can you teach me?
Yes. It's really pretty.
I want to sing the alphabet song.

I'm baking a chocolate cake.
A chocolate cake? Yay!
Can you get the eggs, please.
Sure, mommy.
We'll mix it in this bowl.
I want to help.

My mom is baking a cake.
I love to eat cake.
It's chocolate.

I'm so happy.
Me too, son.

This is fun, dad.

What should I do?
Hold your pole over the water.
Like this?
Yes. Look! You caught a fish.
Oh, daddy! What do I do?
Hold on, son. I'll get a net.

We're sleeping here tonight, Jason.
In the tent?
Yes. It will be fun.
I've never slept in a tent before.
That's why I brought sleeping bags.
Sleeping bags? What's that?
Just slide into it, son.
Hey! I like this. It's warm.

Hey Linda. Want to play?
Okay, Joseph. What do you want to play?
Let's climb this tree.
No. That's dangerous.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is. We can fall.
Just watch, okay. It's easy.
That looks like fun.

Maria, dear. Can you come here?
What is it, mommy?
I want you to pick some lemons.
From the backyard tree?
Yes, dear. I'm making lemonade.
Yummy. I can reach four, I think.
That should be enough, dear.
Okay, mommy.

Let's play in the pool, Helen.
Okay, Linda.
It's fun.
It's so hot today.
Not in the pool.
I know. I like it here.
We can do this every day.
Sure, we can, Linda.

A different hairstyle or color can change a person's entire look.
It can make a person look better or worse.
Jean was about to enter her first day of college.
She wanted a new look.
Her current hairstyle was nice, but it was boring.
She had it since she was a 9th grader.
Her hair right now was straight, long, and blonde.
She went into the hair salon and asked the hairstylist.
What kind of look are you going for? the hairstylist asked.
I want to look like a model, Jean said.
"Well, we can add layers to your hair.
We can also make your hair more blonde, the hairstylist said."
That sounds good! Jean said.
Jean sat in the chair while the hairstylist cut her hair.
Jean couldn't see herself in the mirror because she didn't have her glasses on.
She just trusted the hairstylist.
"An hour later, the hairstylist said, ""Done!"" Jean put on her glasses and looked at herself."
She looked totally different! She liked it, but felt strange.
She could barely even recognize herself.
Jean asked her friends and family what they thought.
Most of them liked it.
They said it made her look edgier but very different.
In fact, when she met up with her friends, they asked who she was.
One of them even tried calling the police when Jean showed up in front of her house.
When Jean was shopping with her friends at the mall, a model scout came up to her and asked if she would consider modeling.
Jean said she would think about it and took his business card.
The new hairstyle was really working out for her.
Kelly's favorite holiday is Halloween.
She loved pumpkin pie, pumpkin spice latte, dressing up, scary movies, and trick-or-treating.
The sad thing, however, is that Kelly knows that she is too old for trick-or-treating.
She is now 21 years old.
She loved how she could get different kinds of candy for free.
This Halloween, Kelly was going to babysit her 10 year-old cousin Albert and his friends.
Kelly dressed up as a pirate.
Her cousin and his friends dressed as ghosts.
Albert and his friends made Halloween themed cupcakes.
The frosting was orange and the sprinkles on top were black.
Afterwards, they carved pumpkins.
"Albert asked, ""What should we do now, Kelly?"" ""Why don't you go trick-or-treating?"" she suggested."
I'm too scared to talk to strangers, Albert said.
Don't worry, I will go with you! Kelly said.
All of them went to the house to the right.
"They knocked on the door and said ""Trick-or-treat!"" The couple smiled and gave the kids a chocolate bar."
Kelly wished they gave her one.
They went to the next house and the family there gave them gummy worms.
The next house they went to was interesting.
The couple there gave them money! Kelly definitely wanted some money.
They went to a total of 10 houses and got more than 10 different types of candy.
They all went back to Kelly's house.
Kelly was sad looking at all their candy.
Then, Albert and his friends gave Kelly a hug and said they loved hanging out with her.
Ophelia was a night shift worker at a hospital.
This meant that she worked late at night.
Ophelia's work schedule was 9 p.m.
to 4 a.m.
Ophelia would sleep during the day while most people were at work.
For the first year of work, Ophelia had a hard time adjusting to the schedule.
She had trouble sleeping during the afternoon.
She was upset that she had to miss out on social events her friends hosted.
It's still hard for Ophelia to adjust, but she is better at it.
When she comes back from work, she goes to the gym for a few hours.
Then, she practices her knitting skills.
Afterwards, she would make herself a healthy meal.
Night shift workers often eat unhealthier than day shift workers.
After lunch, she would watch her favorite TV show.
After that, she would sleep.
The hospital informed the employees that they could send requests to change the time of their shift.
Ophelia was excited about this and immediately sent in a request to change her shift.
A couple of weeks later, the manager gave Ophelia a letter.
The letter stated that her request was rejected.
Ophelia was shocked.
She went to her manager and asked him why.
He said that many night shift workers who requested an earlier shift were elderly.
Ophelia was only 25.
The manager thought that the older employees needed an earlier shift more than Ophelia did.
Ophelia was mad at first, but she thought about the older employees.
Their bones were aching and they're tired.
They do need it more than her.
Janice is turning 21 today.
Originally, she wanted to go to Las Vegas to celebrate.
A lot of people go to Las Vegas for their 21st birthday because in the United States you can legally drink at 21.
However, Janice decided not to go because she wanted to save money to buy a new car.
Janice decided that she just wanted to go to a nice restaurant with her friends.
Janice's birthday was on a Tuesday, and she had class and work on Tuesdays.
She always walked to class with her friend Austin.
When she and Austin met up, she thought he would wish her a Happy Birthday, but he didn't.
Austin has known her for years and he would always remember her birthday.
Janice tried to drop hints.
I wonder what today is, she said.
Just a Tuesday, nothing special. Janice was upset.
She ignored him during class.
After class, Janice went to work.
She expected a few birthday cards or a cake, but nothing.
She was surprised, because employees would always get something for their birthdays.
This made Janice upset.
She didn't even want to go out to eat for her birthday anymore.
When Janice got home, she questioned if anyone even cared about her.
Her friend Liza called her.
Hey, can you open the door, we're here, Liza said.
I don't want to go out anymore, Janice said.
Why not? Can you just open the door, we're already here, Liza said.
Janice opened the door.
Surprise! her friends yelled.
They had a puppy in their hands.
Kathy, Denise, Lauren, Andre, Harrison, and David are best friends.
They all live in San Francisco.
They live in different places and have different jobs, but at the end of their work day, they would meet up in the same cafe.
They also had different personalities, but somehow they make it work.
Kathy is a struggling writer.
She is working on a fantasy novel and trying to get it published.
Denise is a medical student at the University of California, San Francisco.
Lauren is a TV screenwriter.
Andre is also a medical student at the University of California, San Francisco.
Harrison is an investment banker.
David is a graphic designer.
How did they all meet? Kathy and Denise were friends in college and they moved to San Francisco together.
They bumped into Lauren at a wine tasting event.
The three of them became friends.
Denise met Andre at medical school and Denise invited Andre to hang out with Kathy and Lauren at the museum.
Lauren's cousin is Harrison.
Harrison wanted a website for the company he worked at and hired David to design it.
Lauren invited Harrison and David to come to the museum, too.
When the six of them met up, they instantly became friends.
Sometimes their different personalities caused fights.
Kathy was shy and traditional.
Denise was outspoken.
Lauren was kind but also naive.
Andre was funny.
Harrison was smart but also greedy.
David was bossy but also caring.
Even though they were different, though, they all cared about each other.
